FYI: I have tested the changes locally with a real Chime and Doorbell, I don't have an Intercom ( RingOther ) unfortunately. Hi Daniel, thanks for the PR, it's looking pretty good. The fixtures are in You'll need to do something similar to [this]( diff-b487e8bddceac9e066a21d6090120f137d32187383b9a18ae4f2a0abe0f531f1R157-R163) to get the mock working with updates. Also we can't just delete the sensors, they need to be deprecated. If you look these other sensors you should see how. L190 Awesome, thanks for the pointer! See 68abeb7812a6de951686399a56ba2424ea327dff, bdb5a1ebe143afb871dc3cc889e13cda66a9c360 and fc95af66e7136202dca9560325d88b811ec22c45 I've added some tests in 8651208763ad60bff8d4c266497504ef4f762d0f. Hope that's enough, because other more in-depth tests for the other platform still look quite daunting to me :sweat smile: Hey daniel-k I m on my mob so apols if I ve missed something but you should keep the tests for the deprecated. Example in binary sensor of how to create them in the entity registry beforehand should be helpful. You could also create a fixture for this so you don t have to write the same code over and over. I have an example in another PR I have open to migrate siren if you want to look. No worries, here's my next attempt :) 1e01054dc5 Although I feel like there's a bit of redundancy in the tests across platforms regarding depecrated entities. Might be worth looking into refactoring that into some common tests at some point. So you re right about the tests but I ll come back on that tomorrow. I notice that the CI is failing. Are you running pre-commit checks? You should. I ran them manually and obviously forgot to run the checks on my last commit, sorry.

I ran them manually and obviously forgot to run the checks on my last commit, sorry. I\\'ve properly set up the pre-commit hook now and fixed the issue in 5a0b235. The new platform will require a documentation PR linked in the \"additional information\" section (which you can get back from another PR). See for an example of how the docs need to change for the new platform. New platforms generally have to be isolated from other changes in a single PR. In this instance I think it is ok to include the deprecation as it\\'s connected to the new platform and it\\'s just one liners on the entity descriptions. That\\'s an opinion though and a core member may disagree. Hey daniel-k, will go through these tomorrow. Just a quick note on the review process, it\\'s up to you but I see you\\'ve been doing a commit per suggestion. You don\\'t have to do that if it\\'s too laborious. It\\'s fine to do a single commit with all the tweaks and then you can mark the suggestions as resolved if it\\'s as per the suggestion. If it\\'s resolved differently or you disagree then leave it unresolved with a comment and I\\'ll either reply again or agree with it and resolve it. No worries, I\\'m used to doing anyways. The changes are so small and not dependent on each other. This makes your life easier when reviewing (I hope). At least I personally like this way of communicating back the changes that were made. No worries! I\\'m already more than happy that you reviewed it so quickly and even more, you gave super helpful pointers and suggestions! :) I\\'m still finishing up with the refresh after thing and when I\\'m done, I\\'ll re-request review. sdb9696 I think I have addressed every comment of yours now and I have opened a documentation PR here: Therefore, I\\'ve removed the draft status that joostlek had set. I hope that\\'s alright :)']"
