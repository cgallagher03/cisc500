      "['This is just testing the websocket api. Right. The function itself is tested in the library.', 'We should put this test in test websocket api.py', \"The library client should use this auth instance. It looks unused now. We just instantiate it but then don't use it. When the library client wants to get an access token to use, ie before every request, it should use async get access token defined in this class. The library doesn't seem to have been updated to allow this. I recommend reading our library guide on how to structure the library and client: I've reworked the library according to the documentation. I actually like this approach. Everything works fine now except of the websocket connection. It's not possible to establish it and I don't get an error. I've tried very long, but wasn't able to get it working. Could you have a look at the library, please? L371 I don't think you should make a loop when connecting the websocket. Just have a connect method that connects the websocket and stores a reference to it on the client. L148-L160 Then have another method listen that fetches incoming messages and iterates over them and handles them. It's this method that the library user should create a background task for. L374 The benefit of separating the connect and listen methods is that we can make sure we can connect the websocket with a timeout before we create the task that should listen for websocket messages. If we can connect the websocket the chances are high that the websocket communication will work. If we fail to connect during the timeout, we want to raise ConfigEntryNotReady and try again later automatically. Side notes: 1. It looks like there's a double call to update data callbacks: L380-381 L342 2. I'd remove the schedule immediately parameter. The library user can call the callback themselves if needed. L74 If we create a connect method in the library for the websocket, there should also be a disconnect method for the websocket. There is now a close method\"]\n",
